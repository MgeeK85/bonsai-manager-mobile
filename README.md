# Bonsai Manager Mobile

by Mattia Casella

The Bonsai Manager application is a dashboard where you can keep track of information about your own Bonsai collection. You have a login page, a homepage with a slider of images and statistics, a detail “card” with a photo and a list of useful info (species, age, pots, price, etc…) for each bonsai, a table with all your trees, a search function and a create / edit page for inserting new ones.
